# This is the slackrepo configuration file for the msb repository.
#
# The priority order for configuration is:
# (1) Environment variables when slackrepo is called
# (2) ~/.genreprc   [for gen_repos_files.sh only]
# (3) ~/.slackreporc
# (4) /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_msb.conf
#
# %REPO%, %SLACKVER% and %ARCH% will be replaced by the repo ID, Slackware version and arch

# Interesting environment variables you can set :-)

# Use clang instead of gcc

# export CC=clang
# export CXX=clang++

# Use distcc

# export DISTCC_HOSTS="otherhost localhost"
