# This is the slackrepo configuration file for the ponce repository.
#
# The priority order for configuration is:
# (1) Environment variables when slackrepo is called
# (2) ~/.genreprc   [for gen_repos_files.sh only]
# (3) ~/.slackreporc
# (4) /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ponce.conf
#
# %REPO%, %SLACKVER% and %ARCH% will be replaced by the repo ID, Slackware version and arch

# Filestore locations

# Where is the local SlackBuild repo:
SBREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/slackbuilds"

# Where to store cached sources (you will need plenty of space):
SRCREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/source"

# Where to store built packages (you will need plenty of space):
PKGREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/packages/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%"

# Where to keep backups (delete or comment this if you do not want backups):
PKGBACKUP="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/backups/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%"

# Where to find hintfiles for this repo:
HINTDIR="/etc/slackrepo/%REPO%/hintfiles"
DEFAULT_HINTDIR="/etc/slackrepo/%REPO%/default_hintfiles/%SLACKVER%"
#  (remove this if you do not want to use the default hints)

# Where to store log files:
LOGDIR="/var/log/slackrepo/%REPO%"

# Where to keep the database:
DATABASE="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/database_%REPO%_%ARCH%.sqlite3"

# If you want to run slackrepo as an ordinary user, you can remove or comment
# all the above definitions, and use something like this instead, and save it
# to .slackreporc in your ordinary user's home directory:
#
#   #  Note: if you use ~ you should NOT use quotes "..."
#
#   SBREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/slackbuilds
#   SRCREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/source
#   PKGREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/packages/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%
#   PKGBACKUP=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/backups/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%
#   HINTDIR=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/hintfiles
#   LOGDIR=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/logs
#   DATABASE=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/database_%REPO%_%ARCH%.sqlite3
#   #  You will probably want to use the default hintfiles in /etc:
#   DEFAULT_HINTDIR=/etc/slackrepo/%REPO%/default_hintfiles/%SLACKVER%

# Where to store temporary files:
TMP="/tmp/%REPO%"
# you will need plenty of space -- sage and LibreOffice need 12Gb!

# Package substitutions
#
# SUBSTITUTE is a space separated list of dependency substitutions.
# To substitute jdk with openjdk:
#   jdk => openjdk
# To remove six:
#   !six
# Optionally, you can use ',' and extra spaces to make the list look nicer.
#
# Example:
# SUBSTITUTE="jdk => openjdk, jack-audio-connection-kit => jack2"

# These substitutions are SBo dependencies that have been superseded by
# packages in Slackware-current. You can add more substitutions.
